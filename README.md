# micro-cosm
Silly 3dp Extruder I made.

Reuses some Galileo 2 hardware.

main core assembly is as follows

Stepper_motor + ring_gear_housing + (shaft+bearing+gear thing) + Drive gear + shim + bearing

You need 3 heatsets and 2 bhcs screws four mounting, for everything else whatever m3 screws will work
the back plate has two heatsets, each on opposite sides, and the last heatset is used for the tension screw.

The front plate is essentially what holds everything together, based on the g2e manuals you want the main shaft as far back as possible so that's what this does.

this design is kinda meh, feel free to take it and make something superior üëç

FYI the window to the drive gear opposite the idler is for you to stick a toothbrush in when you turn your filament into dust lol
